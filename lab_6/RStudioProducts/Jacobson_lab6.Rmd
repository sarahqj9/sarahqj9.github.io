#Census Data
Collecting Census data on Maryland at the census tract level, which displays the poverty status of those enrolled in College Undergraduate Years and in Graduate or Professional schools, ages 3 or over between the years 2014 and 2019. I also am downloading census data I used this data so that I could better illustrate areas already experiencing poverty, crossed with data on which MD colleges and universities provide food and basic needs resources to aid their students, and determine if there is any correlation to areas in MD already experiencing poverty. 

##Setup
Load and install packages needed. Those being mapview, tidyverse, tidycensus, sf, ggplot2.
To use script, sign up for your own census API key.  (https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.
