## [Food Insecurity on Maryland College Campuses](/food_insecurity)

Current research states that approximately one-third of all students at two- and four- year institutions face food and housing insecurity while earning a degree. Through geospatial analysis on food and poverty rates in Maryland, my research illustrates the connection between MD food insecurity rates to which institutions, based on their location and institution type, are most likely to provide food resources to their students.

The maps on this site are just one part of a larger research project where I take a look at disparities between resources on different types of institutions, along with surveying campus food pantry directors on how their pantries run along with how the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic affected their ability to provide resources, how they had to adapt, and what their pantries look like now to continue to serve the needs of their community.
