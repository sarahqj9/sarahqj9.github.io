## [Food Insecurity Among College Students in Maryland](/food_insecurity)
#### The image displays all colleges and universities in Maryland with a food pantry available to students, in comparison to food insecurity rates by county. This allows us to draw a connection between the individual food insecurity rates of counties, and possible reasons why colleges may have chosen to provide a food pantry, as it is a need of their students and staff that must be met.

## [Baltimore City Canopy Cover Change](/project2/index)
#### Below is a map displaying the city of Baltimore, MD and the changes in tree canopy cover throughout the city. There are many areas with noticeable change, either through a gain or loss of canop cover, and other large areas that have had no change. These changes, or lack thereof, are a result of redlining, with has led to systemic divisions between neighborhoods in Baltimore, and the access they have to green spaces.
