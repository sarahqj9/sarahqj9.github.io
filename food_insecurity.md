# Food Insecurity among College Students in Maryland

## **INTRODUCTION** 
 
  In collaboration with the UMBC food pantry, Retriever Essentials, I am conducting geospatial analyses and generating an online webmap that assesses the pervasive issue of food insecurity among Maryland college students to recommend how institutional food pantries can implement operational best practices to effectively meet student need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Current research states that approximately one-third of all students at two- and four- year institutions face food and housing insecurity while earning a degree. Through geospatial analysis on food and poverty rates in Maryland, my research illustrates the connection between federally recognized poverty areas and food insecurity rates to which institutions, based on their location and institution type, are most likely to provide food resources to their students. We identified campus pantry points-of-contact, and conducted a semi-structured survey to understand campus pantry operations and services in more detail, along with assessing how analyses on how COVID-19 has impacted a pantryâ€™s ability to provide the resources needed by their students. Retriever Essentials and I plan to utilize the data as part of a comprehensive effort to assess the availability of food and basic needs resources on Maryland college campuses, and what campuses can do to better connect students with these resources.

## DATA 

  The data below are series of shapefiles containing Maryland's higher education institutions. This will provide the preliminary base for research on which institutions provided a food pantry or food resources to their students, and then conducting further analysis on the operations of individual food pantries among Maryland colleges and universities. Through an impact survey, I was able to gain data representative of approximately 30% of all Maryland institutions with a food pantry. Data includes the best operational practices for each site, how many clients they serve, how they quantify food and time donated, and how COVID-19 impacted their ability to operate as normal, and continue servicing their communities. The continuation of my data and map analyses will include comparisons of varying economic factors within the state, and how as a result, each region has to service and operate in different ways to meet the needs of their clients.

## ANALYSIS

Data collection began in Fall 2020, with established shapefiles of Maryland institutions found from the Maryland open data portal. Shapefiles included four-year public institutions, four-year private institutions, two-year public institutions, and two-year private institutions. A shapefile from the same source containing Maryland statistical neighborhoods was used to define Maryland state and County boundaries. This allowed us to have an initial list of universities and colleges within Maryland to research.

We conducted extensive online research by taking the identified institutions and researching individual school websites to find the presence of a food pantry, support of an outside pantry, and contact for the person responsible for the pantry. Once we had this information, we updated the list of all Maryland institutions, their pantry status, and a contact for any active pantries a school might have. This list was then able to be appended to our shapefiles for further analysis. With this data we created maps using QGIS to display all Maryland institutions classified by type; those being public or private, and four-year or two-year institutions. Maps were also produced to display only institutions with an active food pantry, or institutions that support an outside food pantry, further classified by type in the results section. We were then able to use simple statistics to find percentages of institutions that provide access to a food pantry. We continued our initial analysis by downloading shapefiles from Johns Hopkins Center for a Liveable Future that covered poverty-related issues within Maryland, so we could hopefully draw a connection between food insecurity and poverty trends within Maryland, and the coorelation between the availability of a food pantry for college students in and around those areas. 

The next step of our analysis involved surveying the operators of the food pantries around Maryland colleges to find information about how their operations have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Using the contacts found in our research step, we emailed a survey developed specifically to understand the day to day operations pre- and post-COVID in order to understand how operations were before and after the pandemic. In total, out of the 33 insitutions, we received 14 survey responses and as was an optional survey, it is therefore subject to response and non-response bias. This data is what we will be using to conduct further analysis on best practices for food pantries, series of maps detailing the connection between food insecurity and college, along with an online, interactive map that students will be able to use to quickly access their school's food resources and pantry information. 

## RESEARCH OUTPUTS

### Colleges and Institutions in Maryland: How does college intersect with food insecurity?

  When considering institution type, and how to best categorize the colleges to better understand the connections between being a student and being food insecure, we found it best to consider schools in two aspects: are they a four-year or two-year institution, and are they private or public? These categories are important to consider, as certain institutions will better service and be accessible to different types of populations. According to the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76), in the United States between the 2007-08 and 2017-18 educational years, prices for undergraduate degrees at public institutions rose by 31% with an average cost of $20,000 a year, and cost of tuition rose 23% with an average cost of $40,000 a year. Another study done by [Georgetown University](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery/) found that roughly 65% of people in the workforce have obtained some postsecondary education, with Bachelor's degree holders earning 57% of all wages. People choose to get degrees because of better wages, benefits, and increased opportunities for employment. However, the cost is great, especially when moving beyond two-year, public universities where the average cost of tuition is approximately $5,000 a year. 
  
  The cost of tuition often dictates which type of student, depending on their wealth and resources, will be able to afford pursuing a postsecondary education. Considering how various socioeconomic factors play into the services and aid that institutions provide their students is crucial when discussing how stress from college courses and paying for tuition intersect with stressors for those experiencing poverty or food insecurity and the effects it can have on a person's physical, emotional, and mental health.

  The map above illustrates which campuses provide food pantries or food resources to their students and staff. Approximately 62% of all Maryland institutions provide a food pantry, while 38% of all institutions do not currently provide a food pantry. All sixteen public, 2-year institutions provided a food pantry, making up 49% of all institutions with food pantries. Public, four-year universities make up one third of all universities with food pantries at 33%, and private, four-year universities make up 18%. Currently there are no private, two-year institutions that provide a food pantry.
