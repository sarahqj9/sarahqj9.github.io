## Access to Food Locations Compared to Social Factors

**Project description:** Various social factors such as race, gender, and sexuality can impact and intersect with one's ability to access certain resources, as can be seen specifically in Baltimore, MD. By creating a correlation between predominantly Black vs. predominantly white neighborhoods, and varying socioeconomic factors, we are able to visualize the growing disparities to access of healthy food resources among the communities.
