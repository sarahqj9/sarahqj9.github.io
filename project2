## Baltimore City Tree Canopy Cover Change from 2007-2015

**Project description:** This project allows for the analysis of green spaces in Baltimore, and how specific neighborhoods may or may not have access to them. Through a long history of redlining, class, and race division, several neighborhoods have received far more, or far less funding to protect green spaces and canopy cover. Canopy cover is important as trees help with cooling of an environment, both through shading and through photosynthesis. Additionally,  other green spaces such as parks and forests provide a mental, emotional, and physical place to escape to and spend time in for people of all ages.
