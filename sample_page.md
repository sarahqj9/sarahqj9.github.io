## Food Insecurity among College Students in Maryland

**Project description:** In collaboration with Retriever Essentials, I am developing an ongoing, GIS centered, research project on how food insecurity affects college students in Maryland. With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have found themselves in need of additional resources due to loss of income, increased healthcare costs, and other unexpected expenses as a result. We hope to study how college food pantries can alleviate hardships for students, alongside creating a live webmap that can help all Maryland college students easily connect to resources near and on their campuses. 

### Food Insecurity Rates in Maryland

One of many developed maps in this entire project, this map highlights the food insecurity rates, by county, in Maryland contrasted against all colleges within Maryland that provide food resources for their students and staff. In order to create this image, I had to use opensource data from the Maryland that gave me most of the data needed for the maps I have developed. To develop the maps, I used ESRI ArcMap as it allows for an easy transition to an online format for the creation of the future webmap. As the project is ongoing, the research has not been completed, but the work is going forward!

## Colleges with Food Pantries vs. Federal Poverty Level Areas
#### The image displays all colleges and universities in Maryland with a food pantry available to students, in comparison to census tracts in Maryland that are at 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. This means that these census tract areas have an average household income that is only 2X above the Federal Poverty Level, and may experience poverty, food, housing, and basic needs insecurity.

## Colleges with Food Pantries within 10 Miles of Federal Poverty Level Areas
#### The image displays all colleges and universities in Maryland with a food pantry available to students that are within a 10 mile radius of areas that are at 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. A lot of campuses, specifically community colleges, have commuter students. We wanted to represent universities and colleges that reflect that, and if they are near a Federal Poverty Level, that may contribute to the need for a food pantry on campus.
